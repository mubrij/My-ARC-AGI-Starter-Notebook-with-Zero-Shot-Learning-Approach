# My-ARC-AGI-Starter-Notebook-with-Zero-Shot-Learning-Approach

My ARC-AGI Starter Notebook for the ARC-AGI competition, which implements a zero-shot learning approach using the Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct model. This notebook serves as a baseline solution, processing input grids, generating predictions, and creating submission files in both JSON and CSV formats. It includes utility functions for grid-to-text conversion, visualization with Matplotlib, and robust error handling with fallback strategies.
Key features:
Zero-Shot Learning: Leverages Qwen2 for pattern analysis without relying on training data.
Grid Processing: Converts 2D grids to text for model input and back to grids for output.
Visualization: Displays input and predicted grids side-by-side for better understanding.
Flexible Output: Generates submissions matching the competition's required format.
